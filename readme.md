# Seaborn Visualization repository 
This project is dedicated to exploring the powerful Seaborn library in Python, focusing on creating high-quality visualizations for data analysis. Through this project, I have gained an in-depth understanding of Seaborn and how to use it effectively to present data insights.
## Key Topics Covered
Seaborn Basics: Introduction to Seaborn's functions and datasets.
Statistical Visualizations: Creating plots like bar plots, box plots, and violin plots.
Relational Plots: Exploring relationships between variables with scatter plots, line plots, and more.
Distribution Plots: Understanding data distributions using histograms, KDE plots, and rug plots.
Categorical Plots: Visualizing categorical data using strip plots, swarm plots, and count plots.
Advanced Customization: Enhancing plots with color palettes, themes, annotations, and facet grids.
